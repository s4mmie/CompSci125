/*Write a complete Java program called Program4.java
 * that reads two words representing passwords from the 
 * Â­keyboard and outputs the number of characters in the 
 * smaller of the two. For example, if the two words are open 
 * and sesame, then the output should be 4, the length of the 
 * shorter word, open. Hint: use the min function. Do not use 
 * techniques we haven't discussed in class.
